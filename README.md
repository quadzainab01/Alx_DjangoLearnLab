# Alx_DjangoLearnLab
“Introduction to Django” project. This project is tailored to help me gain hands-on experience with Django, one of the most popular web frameworks for building robust web applications. Throughout this project, I will set up a Django development environment, learn about Django models and ORM, and explore the Django admin interface.
